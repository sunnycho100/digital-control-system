# 🧠 Segway Control System — SystemVerilog Project

This repository contains all design, simulation, and synthesis files for our **Segway Control System** project.  
Each folder has a specific purpose to keep development organized across phases.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure Overview

### `src/`
> 💡 **Prototype Phase Files**
- Used for early design exploration and temporary HDL/testbench prototypes.
- Place your **in-progress** or **experimental** SystemVerilog files here before they are finalized.
- Once stable and reviewed, move them to `rtl/`.

---

### `rtl/`
> 💡 **Project HDL Directory (Committed Files)**
- Contains the **final and reviewed SystemVerilog source files** for the main project build.
- Only verified RTL modules should be stored here.
- This folder will represent the **official implementation** for synthesis and submission.

---

### `tb/`
> 💡 **Testbenches**
- Contains all testbench files for module- and system-level verification.
- Each module in `rtl/` should have a corresponding testbench here.
- Include simulation-specific helper tasks or utility files.

---

### `sim/`
> 💡 **Simulation Scripts and Results**
- DO/TCL scripts for ModelSim or QuestaSim automation.
- Store waveform configuration (`waves.do`), transcripts, and simulation logs.
- Generated results (e.g., `.wlf`, `.vcd`) should be excluded via `.gitignore`.

---

### `synthesis/`
> 💡 **Synthesis Setup**
- Contains synthesis constraint scripts, TCL files, and reports generated by tools such as Synopsys DC or Quartus.
- Keep synthesis-specific configurations here separate from RTL.

---

### `reports/`
> 💡 **Timing and Utilization Reports**
- Final performance, area, and timing analysis results.
- Upload `.txt` or `.pdf` reports generated after synthesis or simulation.

---

### `constraints/`
> 💡 **FPGA or ASIC Constraints**
- Pin assignment and timing constraint files.
- Example formats: `.xdc`, `.sdc`, `.qsf`.

---

### `scripts/`
> 💡 **Automation and Utility Scripts**
- Python, Shell, or TCL scripts that automate workflow tasks (e.g., build automation, log parsing).

---

### `docs/`
> 💡 **Documentation and Design Notes**
- Design diagrams, specifications, progress notes, and documentation PDFs.
- Place all reports or milestone deliverables here.

---

### `quartus/` or `design_vision/`
> 💡 **Tool-Specific Project Files**
- Each tool’s configuration or workspace files (e.g., Synopsys Design Vision or Intel Quartus projects).
- Do not mix tool-specific outputs with source files.

| Phase | Folder | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Prototype | `src/` | Develop and test new HDL ideas |
| Verified | `rtl/` | Finalized HDL committed for synthesis |
| Verification | `tb/` + `sim/` | Testbenches and simulation results |
| Synthesis | `synthesis/` + `reports/` | Tool output and metrics |
| Documentation | `docs/` | Reports, diagrams, design files |
